In JavaScript, you can pass the API key using the authToken parameter when creating the client.

JavaScript

const { LumaAI } = require('lumaai');

const client = new LumaAI({
  authToken: process.env.LUMAAI_API_KEY
});
Polling for Generation Status and Retrieving Video
In JavaScript, use async/await for handling the polling.

Javascript

npm install node-fetch
Javascript

const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const fs = require('fs');
const { LumaAI } = require('lumaai');

const client = new LumaAI({ authToken: process.env.LUMAAI_API_KEY });

async function generateVideo() {
    let generation = await client.generations.create({
        prompt: "A teddy bear in sunglasses playing electric guitar and dancing"
    });

    let completed = false;

    while (!completed) {
        generation = await client.generations.get(generation.id);

        if (generation.state === "completed") {
            completed = true;
        } else if (generation.state === "failed") {
            throw new Error(`Generation failed: ${generation.failure_reason}`);
        } else {
            console.log("Dreaming...");
            await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 3000)); // Wait for 3 seconds
        }
    }

    const videoUrl = generation.assets.video;

    const response = await fetch(videoUrl);
    const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream(`${generation.id}.mp4`);
    await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        response.body.pipe(fileStream);
        response.body.on('error', reject);
        fileStream.on('finish', resolve);
    });

    console.log(`File downloaded as ${generation.id}.mp4`);
}

generateVideo();

How to get a callback when generation has an update
It will get status updates (dreaming/completed/failed)
It will also get the video url as part of it when completed
It's a POST endpoint you can pass, and request body will have the generation object in it
It expected to be called multiple times for a status
If the endpoint returns a status code other than 200, it will be retried max 3 times with 100ms delay and the request has a 5s timeout
example

TypeScript

const generation = await client.generations.create({
  prompt: "A teddy bear in sunglasses playing electric guitar and dancing",
  callback_url: "<your_api_endpoint_here>"
});
